### What is FHE?

Homomorphic encryption allows some computation (addition, scalar multiplication, ct-ct multiplication) directly on ciphertexts without first having to decrypt it.

Partially Homomorphic Encryption support only one of those possible operation. RSA is an example:
$$
\text{Enc}(m_1) \cdot \text{Enc}(m_2) = m_1^e \cdot m_2^e = (m_1 \cdot m_2)^e = \text{Enc}(m_1 \cdot m_2)
$$


FHE supports Addition AND Scalar Multiplicaiton:
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{cases}
\text{Enc}(m_1) + \text{Enc}(m_2) = \text{Enc}(m_1 + m_2)\\
\text{Enc}(m) \cdot c = \text{Enc}(m \cdot c)
\end{cases}
$$
{{< /math >}}
Fancy! And it exsists!

### LWE & Ring-LWE

> Hiding secrets by adding some noise.

#### Learning With Error (LWE)

Given a random vector $a \in \mathbb{Z}_q^n$, a secret key $s \in \mathbb{B}^n, \mathbb{B} = \set{0, 1}$, a small plaintext message $m \in \mathbb{Z}_t$ with $t \ll q$, and a small noise $e$ sampled from a gaussian distribution centered at 0:
$$
\text{LWE}(m) = (a, a \cdot s + m + e)
$$
$n$ decides the security level we want. The operator "$\cdot$" is a dot product.

The decryption is also straight forward in high-level: 
$$
\text{Dec}_s(\;(a, b)\;) = \lfloor \varphi_s(\;(a, b)\;)\rceil = \lfloor b - a \cdot s \rceil
$$


Think of this: if we always encrypt $m = 0$. A "learning without error" scheme can be easily be solved by setting up $n$ linear equations. However, adding this error makes it very hard to solve. (Oded Regev?)

> The definition I give here is not completely accurate. To encrypt $m$, one should sometimes scale it up or "shift to the left" so that the lower bits are reserved for noise. 
>
> **Toy example**: say $q = 2^{32}$, then we can use a 32 bit unsigned integer for each number. Suppose we allow $m$ to have 4 bits, and the rest $32 - 4 = 28$ lower bits are reserved for our noise.

Additions and scalar mulitiplications are intuitive. ct-ct multiplications needs special design. It's possible!

BFV is a RLWE scheme that supports ct-ct multiplication. $(a_1, b_1) \cdot (a_2, b_2) = (a_1b_1, a_1b_2 + a_2b_1, b_1b_2)$.

#### Supporting larger message?

Notice that in the general definition for LWE, the message we can encrypt is $m \in \mathbb{Z}_t$. This is typically not enough. What if we want a larger message $\mu \in \mathbb{Z}_t^m$? Hence, we typically use a random matrix $A$ for encryption:
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{LWE}(\mu) = (A, A \cdot s + \mu + e)\\
A \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{m \times n}, s \in \mathbb{B}^n, \mu \in \mathbb{Z}_t^m
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
This means that encrypting a vector in $\mathbb{Z}_t^m$ requires $mn$ many $\mathbb{Z}_q$. RLWE helps reduce this!

#### Ring Learning With Error (RLWE)

Ring variant of LWE. Instead of having $a$ as a vector, we upgrade all vector addition and scalar multiplication are upgraded to polynomial multiplications and additions. Now, we have $a \in \mathbb{Z}_q[x] / (x^n + 1), m \in \mathbb{Z}_t[x] / (x^n + 1), s \in \mathbb{B}[x] / (x^n + 1)$. $n$ is the polynomial degree. $q$ and $t$ are coefficient modulus for ciphertext and plaintext. Everything in polynoimal!

#### RLWE is more efficient:

- " LWE problems tend to require rather large key sizes, typically on the order of $n^2$." (Regev's survey) To use LWE, typically need $n$ linear equations with errors, each of them has size $n$ key.  In RLWE, you only need $n$ coefficients. 
- Fast Fourier Transform and Number Theoretic Transform can be applied to polynomials. It makes computation faster!

#### The problem with noise growth

Addition has additive noise growth, multiplication has multiplicative noise growth. This is bad because we cannot perform this computation many times... 

Good news: there is a way to make multiplications have additive noise growth.



### Gadget Decomposition

> How do you calculate $3405 \cdot 6$ by hand?

Simple gadget decomposition (special case):

For a message $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, we scale it to different powers: 
$$
\mathsf{Scale}(m) = m \cdot (10^{\ell - 1}, \ldots, 10^{0})
$$
This creates a vector of size $\ell$ for some chosen number $\ell$. Now, if we want to multiply this encrypted message with a constant $C$, we can calculate the inner product between the decomposed C and this scaled value. Just like what we have learnt in primary school. I.e., we can decompose $C$ to $\text{Decomp}(C) = (C_{\ell - 1}, \ldots, C_{0})$such that
$$
C = \sum_{i = 0}^{\ell -1} C_i 10^i
$$
Then the multiplication becomes: 
$$
C \cdot m =  \mathsf{Decomp}(C) \cdot  \mathsf{Scale}(m)
$$

#### Toy Example

$m = 6, C = 3405, k = 4$
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Decomp}(C) &= (3, 4, 0, 5)\\
\text{Enc}(m) &= (6000, 600, 60, 6) \\
C \cdot m &= 3 \cdot 6000  + 4 \cdot 600 +  5 \cdot 6 = 20430
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}


#### Generalization

Instead of 10, we can use larger base ($B = 256$ for example). Then the gadget looks like $\vec{g} = (B^{\ell - 1}, \ldots, B^{0})$. 
<center>
  <figure>
    <img src=" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20240823023737653.png " style="width:100%;" />
    <figcaption>  </figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

Denote $g^{-1}(v) := \mathsf{Decomp}\_g(v)$.  There is a very good property of gadget decomposition: 
$$
\| g^{-1}(v) \cdot g - v\|_\infty \leq \epsilon
$$

Another level of generalization looks like: 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
G= I_k \otimes \vec{g} = 
\left(\begin{array}{c|c|c}
B^{\ell - 1}& \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
B^0 & \ldots & 0 \\
\hline \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\hline 0 & \ldots & B^{\ell - 1} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & \ldots & B^0
\end{array}\right)

\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
It turns out that this big $G$ here is also a gadget by definition 3.1 in [Building an Efficient Lattice Gadget Toolkit: Subgaussian Sampling and More](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/946.pdf) if we treat each row as an  element. 






### Ring-GSW

This is another FHE scheme. The special thing about this scheme is that it uses RLWE and a special gadget matrix during the encryption stage.
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{RGSW}(m) = Z + m \cdot G && 
Z = (\underbrace{\text{RLWE}(0), \ldots, \text{RLWE}(0)}_{2 \ell}), G = I_2 \otimes \vec{g}
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
This is a Ring-GSW sample that encrypts the message $m$ (without scaling by any factor). This is a special case of RGSW (otherwise $G = I_k \otimes \vec{g}$ for any desired $k$. Check [TFHE](https:/print.iacr.org/2016/870)). And, we also have $2\ell$ rows of RLWE(0). This encryption is straight forward. However, I don't know any decryption methods. Why? Note that some gadget values are very small compared to the ciphertext coefficient modulus, which means $m \cdot g_i$ can be as small as the noise... 



### External Product

> Additive noise growth for ct-ct multiplication!!!

External product using only one gadget decomposition: 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{RGSW} \boxdot \text{RLWE} &\to \text{RLWE} \\
(A, b) &\mapsto A \boxdot b = G^{-1}(b) \cdot A
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
English: we first decompose the RLWE ciphertext, and then multiply it with RGSW.

> In the context of external product, $\text{Decomp}_G(v) \in R^{1\times2l}, A \in R^{2l \times 2}$.

#### Proof sketch

Let $\text{msg}(A) = \mu_A, \text{msg}(b) = \mu_b$. By definition of RLWE, $b = (a, a \cdot s + \mu_b + e) = (a, a \cdot s + 0 + e) + (0, \mu_b) = z_b + (0, \mu_b)$.
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
A \boxdot b &= G^{-1}(b) \cdot A = G^{-1}(b) \cdot (Z_A + \mu_A \cdot G)\\
&= G^{-1}(b) \cdot Z_A + \mu_A \cdot (G^{-1}(b) \cdot G)\\
&= G^{-1}(b) \cdot Z_A + \mu_A \cdot (\epsilon + b)\\
&= G^{-1}(b) \cdot Z_A + \mu_A \cdot \epsilon + \mu_A \cdot (z_b + (0, \mu_b))\\
&= G^{-1}(b) \cdot Z_A + \mu_A \cdot \epsilon + \mu_A \cdot z_b + (0, \mu_A \cdot \mu_b)\\
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}

Decryption is to calculate the linear equation $\varphi_s(\;(a, b)\;) = b - a \cdot s$. Then, rounding the result, everything goes to zero except $\mu_A \cdot \mu_b$. 

#### Why this is good?

Check the noise growth! The advantage for doing this is the first term $G^{-1}(b) \cdot A$. If we don't do the gadget decomposition, say $G^{-1}(b) = b$, and $A$ is a vector, then this term multiplies the error of two messages together. However, because of the gadget decomposition, the error term inside $b$ is upper bounded by $B$.  The total error looks like: 

{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\| \text{Err}(A \boxdot b) \|_\infty\leq 
\| G^{-1}(b) \cdot \text{Err}(A) \|_\infty + |\mu_A| \cdot \epsilon + |\mu_A| \cdot \text{Err}(b)\\

\text{Roughly: } O(B \cdot \text{Err}(A) + |\mu_A| \cdot \text{Err}(b))

\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}


If we have small message $\mu_A$, then this multiplication is roughly free! I must quote this sentence I learnt from Jeremy Kun: "This is useful when the noise growth is asymmetric in the two arguments, and so basically you make the noise-heavy part as small as possible and move the powers of 2 to the other side."

The essence is that we separate RLWE, which is very sensitive to scaling, to smaller parts, and then perform this "digit-by-digit" multiplication. We can do this because we have carefully designed this RGSW scheme so that it stores enough information for all powers of $B$, saving this scaling for RLWE.

### Key Switching

In RLWE, key switching is a technique that helps us change the underlying secret key without decrypting the ciphertext. Formally, we want to change the underlying secret key from $s$ to $t$: 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
c = (a, b) \;\;\; &\longrightarrow \;\;\; c' = (a', b')\\
c = (a, a \cdot s + m + e) \;\;\; &\longrightarrow \;\;\; c' = (a', a' \cdot t + m + e')\\
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span> Key Switching Key(KSK)
$$
\mathsf{KSK}(s, t) = \mathsf{RLWE}_t(s) = (x, x \cdot t + s + e_{\text{new}})
$$
where $x \in \mathbb{Z}_q[X] / (x^n + 1)$ is another random polynomial. This is a new ciphertext encrypting the old secret key.

Then, the new ciphertext $c'$ can be computed by:
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
c' &= (0, b) - a \mathsf{KSK} \\
&= (0, b) - (a  x, a (x t + s + e_{\text{new}}))\\
&= -(ax, (a x t + a s + a e_{\text{new}}) - b)\\
&= -(ax, (a x t + a s + a e_{\text{new}}) - (as + m + e))\\
&= (-ax, -a x t + m + (e - ae_{\text{new}}))\\
&= (a', a't + m + e')
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
Observe that this is still a valid RLWE ciphertext. Here is another way to to check if $c'$ has correctly encrypted the message $m$ under the key $t$. We check this by applying the phase function (or simply decrypt it): 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi_t(c') &= \varphi_t(\; (0, b) - a \cdot \mathsf{KSK}\;)\\
&= \varphi_t((0, b)) - a \cdot \varphi_t(\mathsf{KSK})\\
&= (b - 0 \cdot t) - a \cdot (s + e_{\text{new}})\\
&= (b - a \cdot s) - a \cdot e_{\text{new}}\\
&= m + e - a \cdot e_{\text{new}}\\
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
This is consistant with the aboved result. 

**HOWEVER**, the error $a \cdot e_\text{new}$ can be too large! $a$ is randomly sampled in $\mathbb{Z}_q[X] / (x^n + 1)$. The trick is to use Gadget Decomposition! Decomposing $a$ into smaller chunks, and scaling the underlying message inside KSK into different levels, without scaling up the error.
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Scaling this up: }\mathsf{KSK}(s, t)'_i = \mathsf{RLWE}_t^*(sB^i) = (x, x \cdot t + sB_i + e_{\text{new}}), i = 0, \ldots, \ell - 1\\
&\text{Decomposing this: }a \Rightarrow G^{-1}(a) = \set{a_i : i = 0, \ldots l-1}
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
The new ciphertext is computed: 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
c' &= (0, b) - G^{-1}(a) \cdot \mathsf{KSK}(s, t)'\\
&= (0, b) - \sum_{i = 0}^{\ell-1}G^{-1}(a)_i \cdot \mathsf{KSK}(s, t)'_i
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}
Check the phase of this ciphertext: 
{{< math >}}
$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi_t(c') &= \varphi(0, b) - \sum_{i = 0}^{\ell-1}G^{-1}(a)_i \cdot \varphi_t
\left( \mathsf{KSK}(s, t)'_i \right)\\
&= b - \sum_{i = 0}^{\ell - 1} G^{-1}(a) \cdot (sB_i + e_i)\\
&= b - s \cdot (G^{-1}(a) \cdot G) - \sum_{i = 0}^{\ell - 1}\underbrace{G^{-1}(a)}_{\mathcal{O}(B)} \cdot e_i\\
&= b - a \cdot s + e'
\end{align*}
$$
{{< /math >}}


#### Substitution / Frobenius Automorphism

The underlying $X$ is multiplied by $k$. So the term $X^i \mapsto X^{ik}$: 
$$
\mathsf{Subs}(\mathsf{RLWE}(\mu(X)), k) = \mathsf{RLWE}(\mu(X^k))
$$
This can be implemented using the key switching algorithm. 

Essence: to apply the Frobenius automorphism on the message, we have to apply it to the whole ciphertext. But we can use a new key $s(X^k)$ to replace $s(X)$ to cancel the changes in the random part $a(X) \mapsto a(X^k)$. Then, decrypting the message leaves only the message $\mu(X^k)$. We don't care the error term because the variance of the error is not changed.
