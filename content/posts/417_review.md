I have had a wonderful summer as I have been able to take Math 417 with Professor Chales Rezk. He is a very very good teacher and I have learnt a lot from him. Thanks!

These are the notes I have taken during the course. It includes the greate Theorems, Lemmas and Propositions that we have learnt in the course.
