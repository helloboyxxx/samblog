#### Question

Can you find a closed formula for the sum of the $p$-th powers of the first $n$ positive integers? That is, we need a closed formulat for the sequence:

$$
h_n=a_p n^p+a_{p-1} n^{p-1}+\cdots+a_1 n+a_0, \quad(n \geq 0)
$$


**Solution**

The method is to use difference sequences. We already know the following:

$$
1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3 = (1+2+\ldots + n)^2
$$
Now we want a new method. First, construct a difference table for $n^3$.

Let's verify the following equation:

$$
1^3 + \ldots + n^3 = 0 \cdot \binom{n+1}{1} + 1 \cdot \binom{n+1}{2} + 6 \cdot \binom{n+1}{3} + 6 \cdot \binom{n+1}{4}
$$

Use Pascal's formula for the last two terms. Then expand them to verify that this equation is true.


<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span>

Let $(h_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of numbers. We define a new sequence: 

$$
\Delta h_0, \Delta h_1, \Delta h_2, \ldots, \Delta h_n, \ldots
$$
call the first-order difference sequence of $(h_n)_{n \geq 0}$ by: 

$$
\Delta h_n = h_{n+1} - h_n
$$

> Discrete derivative.

<span style="color:#28a745">Definition</span>

The second-order difference sequence of $(h_n)_{n \ge 0}$ is defined by 

$$
\Delta^2 h_0, \Delta^2 h_1, \Delta^2 h_2, \ldots, \Delta^2 h_n, \ldots,
$$
where 

$$
\Delta^2 h_n = \Delta(\Delta h_n) = \Delta h_{n+1} - \Delta h_{n}.
$$




Then we can construct the difference table using this new notation: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20231129212412033.png" alt="image-20231129212412033" style="zoom:50%;" />

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span> 8.2.1

Let the general term of a sequence be a polynomial of degree $p$ in $n$: 
$$
h_n = a_pn^p + a_{p-1}n^{p-1} + \ldots + a_1n + a_0, \quad(n\geq 0)
$$
Then, $\Delta^{p+1} h_n = 0$ for all $n \geq 0$.

<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Induction on $p$. IH: 

$$
\Delta^{p+1}h_n = 0, \forall n \geq 0, \forall p \text{-degree sequence } (h_n)_{n\geq 0}
$$

Base case: $p = 0$, then $(h_n)\_{n \geq 0}$ is a constant sequence $\implies \Delta h_n = h_{n+1} - h_n = 0$.

Induction step: Assume this holds for $p-1, p \geq 1$. Let's show that this holds for $p$ as well. We have: 
`
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta h_n = h_{n+1} - h_n &= \left(a_p(n+1)^p+a_{p-1}(n+1)^{p-1}+\cdots+a_1 n+a_0\right)\\
& \quad -\left(a_p n^p+a_{p-1} n^{p-1}+\cdots+a_1 n+a_0\right)\\
&= (a_p(n+1)^p - a_p n^p) + \text{polynomial with degree }p-1
\end{align*}
$$
`
By IH, the polynomial with degree $p-1$ goes to zero. Since we want to show that $\Delta^{p+1} h_n$ still goes to zero, we need to show that:

$$
a_p(n+1)^p - a_p n^p = 0
$$

Now, to solve this, we can use binomial theorm: 

`
$$
\begin{align*}
a_p(n+1)^p - a_p n^p &= a_p\left( \sum_{i=0}^{p}\binom{p}{i}n^{i} \right) - a_pn^p\\
&= a_p\left( \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}n^i \right) + a_p n^p - a_pn^p\\
&= a_p\left( \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \binom{p}{i}n^i \right)
\end{align*}
$$
`

Which means that this polynomial also has degree $p-1$. Combining with the term above, we have: 
$$
\Delta ^{p+1} = \Delta^p(\Delta h_n) = \Delta^p(\text{Polynomial with degree }p-1) = 0
$$
$\blacksquare$



<span style="color:#599eff">Lemma</span> Linearity of difference

Let $(f_n)\_{n\geq 0}$ and $(g_n)\_{n\geq 0}$ be two sequences of numbers. Let $(h_n)\_{n\geq 0}$ be a sequence defined by: 
$$
h_n = g_n + f_n
$$
For every $p \geq 0$ we have: 
$$
\Delta^p h_n = \Delta^p g_n + \Delta^p f_n
$$
<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

It suffices to show that: 
$$
\Delta (f_n + g_n) = \Delta f_n + \Delta g_n
$$
Expand this and use commutative property to show this: 

`
$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta h_n &=h_{n+1}-h_n \\ 
&=\left(g_{n+1}+f_{n+1}\right)-\left(g_n+f_n\right) \\ 
&=\left(g_{n+1}-g_n\right)+\left(f_{n+1}-f_n\right) \\ 
&=\Delta g_n+\Delta f_n
\end{align*}
$$

**Question**

Can we recover a sequence by knowing the $0^{\text{th}}$ diagonal of its difference table?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20231129212412033.png" alt="image-20231129212412033" style="zoom:50%;" />

Note that the $0-$diagonal has the terms:
$$
\Delta^0 h_0, \Delta^1 h_0, \Delta^2 h_0, \Delta^3 h_0, \ldots
$$


<span style="color:#599eff">Lemma</span>

The general term of the sequence $\left(h_n\right)\_{n \geq 0}$ such that the Oth diagonal of its difference table is

$$
\underbrace{000 \cdots 0}_{p \text { zeros }} 1000 \cdots
$$
equals to

$$
h_n= \binom{n}{p}
$$
<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

From the 0-diagonal, we can first try to recover the 1-diagonal, 2-diagonal... and so on: 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helloboyxxx/images-for-notes/master/uPic/image-20231205094951946.png" alt="image-20231205094951946" style="zoom:50%;" />

Say the $1$ is the fifth number to appear in the 0-diagonal, then it also appears at the fifth position in the first row. All the other terms in the first row are zero. We are then looking for a sequence that has the following properties: 
$$
h_0 = h_1 = h_2 = h_3 = h_4 = 0, h_1 = 1, 
$$
Thus, if $h_n$ is sequence of degree 4, it has roots at $0, 1, 2, 3$. Write out out simple guess, we have:
$$
h_n = c \cdot n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot (n-3)
$$
for some constant $c$. To satisfies the term $h_1 = 1$, $c = \frac{1}{4!}$. We discover that $h_n = \binom{n}{4}$. More generally, $h_n = \binom{n}{p}$ if there are $p$ zeros in the beginning of the 0-diagonal.



Intuition: using the linearity property of differences and the fact that the 0th diagonal of a difference table determines the entire difference table, and hence the sequence itself, we obtain the next theorem.

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span> 8.2.2

The general term of the sequence whose difference table has its 0th diagonal equal to
$$
c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_p, 0,0,0, \ldots, \quad \text { where } c_p \neq 0
$$
is a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p$ satisfying
$$
h_n=c_0\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
0
\end{array}\right)+c_1\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
1
\end{array}\right)+c_2\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
2
\end{array}\right)+\cdots+c_p\left(\begin{array}{l}
n \\
p
\end{array}\right)
$$


Now, we can back to the initial question: can we find a closed formula for the sum of the $p$-th powers of the first $n$ positive integers? Now we have the tools. 

We can first write out the difference table. Then, we look at the 0-diagonal, and we reconstruct the sequence, but in the form we see in Theorem 8.2.2. Here is an example: 

<span style="color:#04c2b2">Exercise</span>

Consider the sequence with general term
$$
h_n=n^3+3 n^2-2 n+1, \quad(n \geq 0)
$$
The 0-diagonal is $1,2,12,6,0,0, \ldots$. By using Theorem 8.2.2, we get: 
$$
h_n = \binom{n}{0} + 2\binom{n}{1} +12\binom{n}{2} + 6\binom{n}{3}
$$
Summing them up:
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} h_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{k}{0} + 2\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{k}{1} +12\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{k}{2} + \sum_{k=0}^{n}6\binom{k}{3}
$$
By hokey-stick identity, this turns to: 
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} h_k = \binom{n+1}{1} + 2 \binom{n+1}{2} + 12 \binom{n+1}{3} + 6\binom{n+1}{4}
$$


> The general expression of what we have calculated.

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span>

Theorem 8.2.3 Assume that the sequence $h_0, h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n, \ldots$ has a difference table whose 0 th diagonal equals
$$
c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_p, 0,0, \ldots
$$

Then
$$
\sum_{k=0}^n h_k=c_0\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1 \\
1
\end{array}\right)+c_1\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1 \\
2
\end{array}\right)+\cdots+c_p\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+1 \\
p+1
\end{array}\right)
$$

> Proof is the same as our calculation above.

Next, we discuss the sequence
$$
h_n = n^p
$$
for some constant $p$.

Bell numbers

### <span style="color:#3c66b5">Theorem</span> 

If $p \geq 1$, then
$$
B_p = \binom{p-1}{0} B_0 + \binom{p-1}{1}B_1 + \ldots + \binom{p-1}{p-1}B_{p-1}
$$
<span style="color:#eb861c">Proof</span>

Here is the construction: 

There are $p$ elements in total, and some boxes.

- Fix the element $p$.
- Fix $t \in \set{0, \ldots, p-1}$ which chooses the number of elements in the box containning $p$. 

Let $a_t = $ number of the choices of elements which are in the box with $p$, which equals $\binom{p-1}{t}$

It remains to partition $p-(t-1)$ elements into indistinguishable non-empty boxes $B_{p-t-1}$ ways. Writing out the relation we get:
